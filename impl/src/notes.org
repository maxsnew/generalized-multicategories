A static ctx should be a NEListof (Decl SemVal, Decl Generator) The
Decl

SemVals are *known* definitions. The Decl Generators are *parameters*
that can be instantiated.

A DBRef is a reference to a Decl Generator in the static context. When
the parameters are instantiated with a [SemVal], it is a pointer into
this dynamic context.

Explicitly a DBRef is either
- Later DBRef -- a pointer to a "superparameter"
- Now   Nat   -- a pointer to a parameter 

There needs to be some kind of "instantiate" function for all semantic
forms.

For instance,

instantiateSet :: SemSet -> [SemVal] -> SemSet
instantiateSet (Now   n) g = assertSet (g !! n)
instantiateSet (Later d) g = d
